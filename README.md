# Welcome to The Greatest Checkers Game of All time
genuinely, I have put a lot of effort into this so please enjoy. 


## Installation(if you are just playing checkers):
1. Nothing crazy, just install pygame using 
```pip install pygame```
This is the "engine" that is being used for this checkers game

2. Then download the source code here and extract it in a folder
3. Now open the checkers_main file and run it. 

### What if I want to play all of the series? 
Then you need to just go to the main root or the seperate repository provided
in order to access the rest of our games:
- ```https://github.com/arsamasefi1387/checktacinvaders```

## some basic rules:
The game is not forced captures which means you are able to not take a piece if
it's strategically not good. 
the small box you see is for scoreboard and the wins each player has gotten in
the game. 
If you loose all your pieces you lose, if your opponent does, you win. If you
run out of time you lose, if you can't move anything despite having pieces on
the board, you lose. 
Start the game right after getting into it since your clock will run out. 
you could always go to the timers.py file to change the time.


### Side Notes 
#### NOTE: 
- the starting menu has not been implemented since there will be another
menu provided, also, the overall timer does not stop since that kills the
purpose of this timer, also, most of the commands are registered with
keyboard(except moving the pieces) because it is way easier to manage them
than when it comes to mouse actions. On top of that, it is assumed that the
user installing the game already knows the rules of checkers, the README file
is also required for the user to be read. Also, the additional
functionalities have been tried to be as useful as possible but they might
not be really useful for average user(such as the scoreboard and the overall
timer implemented) 

- another side note is that some portion of code(which has been reduced
over time is inspired from youtube videos, article, and source codes,etc.)
These are not much and are all mentioned that they are from other sources if
you ever reach them.
- unfortunately there is no settings option yet which will be provided in the
future to change the time control and whether capturing pieces is forced or
not.
